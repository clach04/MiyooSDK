# Miyoo SDK
Docker environment for developing Miyoo Linux apps.

## Introduction
Miyoo is a handheld retro game emulator. It supports a variety of classic game emulators and indie games, which are generally based on the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) framework:

This repo provides a battery included environment for compiling graphics apps on Miyoo. A [simplest demo](./demo) is also available.

## Usage
Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. Just init the environment with precompiled toolchain:

``` bash
cd MiyooSDK
wget http://fe-lab.gaoding.com/miyoo/toolchain.tar.gz

docker pull debian:9
docker build -t miyoo_sdk .
```

Then we have the `miyoo_sdk` docker image ready. We can try out the toolchain in terminal now:

``` bash
docker run -it --rm miyoo_sdk
```

Build demo app:

``` bash
cd demo
./build.sh
```

Now we can move the `demo.out` output to SD card and start it from the App Installer on Miyoo. For a standalone icon entry, checkout the [GMenu2X](https://mtorromeo.github.io/gmenu2x/documentation/) documentation to create links.
